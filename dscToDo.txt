Create an app called "Slaying Monsters" 
Features:

- Actions: Player and Monster Take turns to make a move , game ends when either is has 0 health

BONUS: there's is a log of each turn and a pop up when the game ends

How about a REST API with 1 endpoint that receives 
An email and a frequency in seconds 

So when the endpoint receives it , it starts a cron job that schedules sending spam emails to that email in the amount of frequency 

This is to be hosted on Heroku
[23:27, 7/11/2019] Geektutor dsc: Android should do the same as frontend and upload the APK on GitHub
[23:28, 7/11/2019] Geektutor dsc: Frontend should host it on heroku too.

All codes should be on GitHub.

Good luck everyone.

I would send submission link at 11pm tomorrow.
